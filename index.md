I am a computer scientist in
[Livermore Computing](https://computation.llnl.gov/livermore-computing) at
[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/). My current
focus is developing, supporting, and maintaining the parallel and distributed
file systems across the computing center.
